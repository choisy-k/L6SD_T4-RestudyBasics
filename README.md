# L6SD_T4-RestudyBasics
Personal project; an attempt to apply the knowledge I've gained from watching Coding Droplet's videos on .NET MAUI basics.

What am I trying to do by restudying?
- Familiarising myself with how the UI looks and works. I want to be able to create an appealing UI design.
- Differentiating layouts, pages, and controls, especially layouts. When is the best time for me to use an Absolute layout or a Flex layout? Does a situation require a TableView, or can I just wing it by Grid layout? Questions like that are what I hope to answer by the end of this project.
- Cementing the knowledge to my brain, because I know I will forget things easily if I don't do this.

Good luck, me.
